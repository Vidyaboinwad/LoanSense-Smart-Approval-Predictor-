# LoanSense-Smart-Approval-Predictor-
LoanSense → A creative blend of “Loan” and “Sense” — implying intelligent insight into loan applications. It suggests the system has a "sense" or understanding of which loans should be approved.  Smart Approval Predictor → Highlights that the system uses smart (AI/ML-based) logic to predict loan approval outcomes.
